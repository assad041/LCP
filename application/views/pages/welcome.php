                                            <p>Hi, I'm Assaduzzaman Noor and I'm happy to welcome you to Introduction to C Programming.</p>
                                            <p> I am very excited to teach this course because I love the idea that we finally will have some course that really will explain the basics to as many people as possible. I love working with people and I love working with technology and I think the best thing we can do is have as many people involved as possible to really make sure that we're building things that everyone can use. In this course, we will be covering the basics. I really can't emphasize enough that we will be starting at the very basic building blocks. We'll start off talking about what's called syntax and semantics. What are the actual codes that people write? Are there any special meanings behind any of these words that can convey special information to those who may not be able to access the web the same way I do? Perhaps, someone who uses special accessibility tools. After we cover the syntax and semantics, we're going to talk more about the accessibility idea that I just eluded to. </p>

                                            <p>We're also going to be talking about getting started in technology and writing code. When I mean talking about getting started I mean really talking about getting started, right down to you and I are gonna walk through together on how we're going to create a file. One of the things I think that really trips people up when their starting to learn computer science or any type of technology based criteria, or curriculum, is that professors or instructors say let's get started, here's your homework. Go ahead and do it and everyone just kind of stops cuz they're not sure where to get started. I really want to be there for you to show you how to get started and get off on the right foot. </p>
