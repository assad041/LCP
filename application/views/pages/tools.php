                      <p>If you want to set up your environment for C programming language, you need the following two software tools available on your computer, (a) Text Editor and (b) The C Compiler.</p>
                      <h3 class="text-info" style="text-align:center">Text Editor</h3>
                      <p>This will be used to type your program. Examples of few a editors include Windows Notepad, OS Edit command, Brief, Epsilon, EMACS, and vim or vi.</p>
                      <p>The name and version of text editors can vary on different operating systems. For example, Notepad will be used on Windows, and vim or vi can be used on windows as well as on Linux or UNIX.</p>
                      <p>The files you create with your editor are called the source files and they contain the program source codes. The source files for C programs are typically named with the extension "<b>.c</b>".</p>
                      <p>Before starting your programming, make sure you have one text editor in place and you have enough experience to write a computer program, save it in a file, compile it and finally execute it.</p>
                      <h3 class="text-info" style="text-align:center">The C Compiler</h3>
                      <p>The source code written in source file is the human readable source for your program. It needs to be "compiled", into machine language so that your CPU can actually execute the program as per the instructions given.</p>
                      <p>The compiler compiles the source codes into final executable programs. The most frequently used and free available compiler is the GNU C/C++ compiler, otherwise you can have compilers either from HP or Solaris if you have the respective operating systems.</p>
                      <p>The following section explains how to install GNU C/C++ compiler on various OS. We keep mentioning C/C++ together because GNU gcc compiler works for both C and C++ programming languages.</p>
